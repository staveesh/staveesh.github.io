Wrapped up my summer internship at [Cisco ThousandEyes](https://www.thousandeyes.com/)! It was a fantastic experience working with the Research team on building event detection pipelines for residential broadband performance. I am especially grateful to [Udit Paul](https://u-paul.github.io/) and [Arian Niaki](https://arianniaki.github.io/) for their mentorship and support throughout the internship.
