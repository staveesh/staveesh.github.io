As a fourth year PhD student at the University of Chicago, I am currently working on Internet measurements, operations and observability. I am a member of the Network Operations and Internet Security (NOISE) lab, where I am advised by [Prof. Nick Feamster](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~feamster/). My PhD research aims to understand the spatial and temporal nature of Internet quality disparities through cross-sectional measurement data. Until the third year, my work explored this problem space through a socio-technical lens. More recently, the focus of my research has shifted towards understanding the co-occurrence between Internet performance disruptions across ISPs and regions. The remaining duration of my PhD will be dedicated towards understanding how we can leverage insights from these co-occurrence patterns to determine *where* and *when* to measure Internet performance.

I also bring industry experience to my research. I spent a summer as a Research Intern at [Cisco ThousandEyes](https://https://www.thousandeyes.com/), where I worked on building event detection pipelines for residential broadband performance. Earlier in my career, I was a Software Engineer in the Finance Technology sector—first at [PayPal](https://paypal.com), where I built systems to evaluate fraud detection models, and then at [ePayLater](https://epaylater.in), where I developed product features for a “buy now, pay later” service.

Before starting my PhD, I was at the [University of Cape Town](https://uct.ac.za/) for my masters, where I had the privilege of working with [Dr. Josiah Chavula](https://www.josiahchavula.com/) on developing measurement data collection systems for resource-constrained environments. I completed my undergraduate studies at [BITS Goa](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/).
